# calc
A calculator that suffers from floating precision.
This calculator suffers from floating point precision and isn't much more than a fun project. I recommend against using it as a calculator. If you have feedback I would love to hear it so I can improve. Makefile uses GCC with a recursive call to itself with the -j4 flag. The calculator is currently 100% terminal based.
